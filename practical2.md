## Introduction

A **Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)** is a process used to identify and evaluate privacy risks associated with a system that collects or processes personal information.

An Online Food Delivery System handles different types of customer information, including **name, phone number, delivery address, order details, location information, and payment-related data**.

The purpose of this assessment is to identify possible privacy risks and recommend suitable measures to protect customer information.

---

## Procedure

1. Identify the personal data collected by the system.
2. Identify the purpose of collecting the data.
3. Determine who can access the collected information.
4. Identify where the information is stored and processed.
5. Identify possible privacy risks.
6. Assess the likelihood and impact of each risk.
7. Develop suitable measures to reduce the identified risks.
8. Establish appropriate data retention and deletion practices.
9. Review the system for privacy improvements.

# Major Privacy Risks Identified

## 1. Exposure of Delivery Address

The system requires a customer's address to complete a food delivery.

### Risk

Unauthorized access to delivery addresses could expose a customer's residential or workplace location.

### Mitigation

- Encrypt address information.
- Restrict access to authorized employees and delivery personnel.
- Delete outdated addresses when they are no longer required.
- Avoid displaying full addresses unnecessarily.

---

## 2. Location Tracking

The application may use location information to identify nearby restaurants or track an active delivery.

### Risk

Continuous location tracking may reveal information about a customer's movements and frequently visited places.

### Mitigation

- Request location permission only when necessary.
- Avoid continuous background tracking.
- Allow users to disable location access.
- Delete unnecessary location history.

---

## 3. Payment Information

Customers may make payments through debit cards, credit cards, wallets, or other online payment methods.

### Risk

Improper handling of payment information could result in financial or personal data exposure.

### Mitigation

- Use a trusted payment gateway.
- Encrypt payment-related communication.
- Avoid storing complete card details unnecessarily.
- Follow appropriate payment security standards.

---

## 4. Customer Account Security

Customer accounts may contain names, contact details, addresses, and order history.

### Risk

A compromised account could expose several categories of personal information.

### Mitigation

- Use strong passwords.
- Provide multi-factor authentication.
- Implement account lockout or suspicious-login detection.
- Notify users about unusual account activity.

---

## 5. Third-Party Data Sharing

The system may share required information with restaurants, delivery partners, payment providers, cloud providers, or other service providers.

### Risk

Personal information may be accessed by organizations outside the direct control of the customer.

### Mitigation

- Share only necessary information.
- Limit third-party access.
- Review third-party privacy and security practices.
- Establish appropriate data-processing agreements.

---

# Privacy Protection Measures

1. Use **strong authentication** for customer and administrator accounts.

2. Encrypt sensitive information during **transmission and storage**.

3. Implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**.

4. Collect only the information required to provide the service.

5. Request location access only when necessary.

6. Do not store complete payment card information unless required and appropriately protected.

7. Establish a clear **data retention and deletion policy**.

8. Allow customers to review and update their personal information.

9. Restrict access to customer addresses and contact information.

10. Regularly review third-party applications and service providers.

11. Maintain security logs to detect unauthorized access.

12. Provide users with a clear privacy notice explaining how their information is used.
